The first section of the analysis covers a high level look at the district as a whole. Covering the sount, size, and budget of the schools within the district, as well as, scores.

The second section covers the same categories but breaks down the data by school. 

Then we show the top five and bottom five schools based on overall scores.

Then we show Math and Reading scores by grade. 

Next we show scores broken down by oer student spending.

Finally we show results based on school type.

Scores by school type shows us that charter schools are greatly outperforming district schools.

Scores by School Size shows that while there is little difference in scores between small and medium schools, large schools underperform. 

These results are likely linked becasue all of the district schools are large and charter schools fall into all three categories. 

Counterintuitively, the more money a school spends per student, the lower that school's mean test score is.
